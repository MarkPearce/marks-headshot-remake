Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, additional spells you learn, and additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. The bloodlines presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.3qqvnC2U8W26yae7]{Aberrant}</strong> A strange and unknowable influence gives you occult spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.vhW3glAaEfq2DKrw]{Angelic}</strong> Holy grace bestows divine spells upon you.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.w5koctOVrEcpxTIq]{Demonic}</strong> A sinful corruption gives you divine spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.o39zQMIdERWtmBSB]{Diabolic}</strong> A bond with devils gives you divine spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHabYxSgYK0XbjhM]{Draconic}</strong> The blood of dragons grants you arcane spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RXRnJcG4XSabZ35a]{Elemental}</strong> The power of the elements manifests in you as primal spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.eW3cfCH7Wpx2vik2]{Fey}</strong> Influence from the fey gives you primal spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tYOMBiH3HbViNWwn]{Genie}</strong> Through lineage, magic, or wishes made real, the blood of a noble genie flows through your veins.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.O0uXZRWMNliDbkxU]{Hag}</strong> The blight of a hag has given you occult spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZEtJJ5UOlV5oTWWp]{Imperial}</strong> An ancient power grants you arcane spells.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.5Wxjghw7lHuCxjZz]{Nymph}</strong> One of your ancestors was inspired by a nymph, or perhaps was a nymph themself, and now the beauty of nature lives in you.</li>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.PpzH9tJULk5ksX9w]{Psychopomp}</strong> For good or ill, your ancestors' deeds drew the attention of psychopomps, or you might somehow count one in your family tree.

Bloodline spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity. Unlike other characters, you don't need to do anything specific to Refocus, as the power flowing through your veins naturally replenishes your focus pool.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points. The full rules can be found here.</p>\n<h3>Reading A Bloodline Entry</h3>\n<p>A bloodline entry contains the following information:</p>\n<p><strong>Spell List</strong> You use this magical tradition and spell list.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Skills</strong> You become trained in the listed skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spells</strong> You automatically add the spells listed here to your spell repertoire, as described in the Spell Repertoire class feature. At 1st level, you gain a cantrip and a 1st-level spell. You learn the other spells on the list as soon as you gain the ability to cast sorcerer spells of that level.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Spells</strong> You automatically gain the initial bloodline spell at 1st level and can gain more by selecting the Advanced Bloodline and Greater Bloodline feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Magic</strong> Whenever you cast a bloodline spell using Focus Points or a granted spell from your bloodline using a spell slot, you gain a blood magic effect. If the blood magic offers a choice, make it before resolving the spell. The blood magic effect occurs after resolving any checks for the spell's initial effects and, against a foe, applies only if the spell is a successful attack or the foe fails its saving throw. If the spell has an area, you must designate yourself or one target in the area when you cast the spell to be the target of the blood magic effect. All references to spell level refer to the level of the spell you cast.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a sorcerer, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-level spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 3-17: Sorcerer Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\"><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a sorcerer. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Spell Repertoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire.

At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new bloodline spell and two other 2nd-level spells, and so on.

If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">Swapping Spells in your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sorcerer Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a sorcerer class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell level at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled you mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increase to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Bloodline Paragon<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-level spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.6SEDoht4dXEJE5SW]{Bloodline Perfection} sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack rolls and spell DCs for spells of your bloodline's tradition increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"sorcerer","schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["cha"]},"items":{"2dihl":{"id":"lURKSJZAGKVD6cH9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/spellbook.webp","level":1,"name":"Spell Repertoire (Sorcerer)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"4r1hh":{"id":"JQAujUXjczVnYDEI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/resolve.webp","level":17,"name":"Resolve","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"5wsjn":{"id":"D8CSi8c9XiRpVc5M","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/alertness.webp","level":11,"name":"Alertness","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"7nvmf":{"id":"feCnVrPPlKhl701x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bloodline-paragon.webp","level":19,"name":"Bloodline Paragon","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"b6ose":{"id":"TUOeATt52P43r5W0","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/lightning-reflexes.webp","level":9,"name":"Lightning Reflexes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"ds47l":{"id":"9XLUh9iMepZesdmc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Weapon Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"erm0v":{"id":"cD3nSupdCvONuHiE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/expert-spellcaster.webp","level":7,"name":"Expert Spellcaster","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"i55qe":{"id":"9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon Specialization","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"jx0fg":{"id":"gmnx7e1g08bppbqt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/signature-spells-sorcerer.webp","level":1,"name":"Sorcerer Spellcasting","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"pryw9":{"id":"VKRjmXxBFLrJK01c","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/signature-spells-sorcerer.webp","level":3,"name":"Signature Spells","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"q2jao":{"id":"gU7epgcPSm0TD1UK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/defensive-robes.webp","level":13,"name":"Defensive Robes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"q8nk5":{"id":"Hfaa7TuLn3nE8lr3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/legendary-spellcaster.webp","level":19,"name":"Legendary Spellcaster","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"qimsg":{"id":"2goYo6VNbwC6aKF1","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/choice-feature.webp","level":1,"name":"Bloodline","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"r346v":{"id":"H6ziAPvCipTPG8SH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bloodline-spells.webp","level":1,"name":"Bloodline Spells","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"tr1s2":{"id":"70jqXP2eS4tRZ0Ok","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/magical-fortitude.webp","level":5,"name":"Magical Fortitude","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"zmu64":{"id":"l1InYvhnQSz6Ucxc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/master-spellcaster.webp","level":15,"name":"Master Spellcaster","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"}},"hp":6,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":2},"perception":1,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"aKpd8zBv3CLRLyjl":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classes.15Yc1r6s9CEhSTMe"},"pf2e":{"insertedClassFeaturesLevel":1}}},{"_id":"8t44jb4be9kj0bof","name":"Bloodline: Undead","type":"feat","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/undead.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The touch of undeath runs through your blood.
